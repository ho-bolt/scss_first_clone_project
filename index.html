            “Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of
            the most affecting in horror. Some may be simple black cat scares,
            others may be more subdued or nuanced. Many come from films that
            aren't necessarily “horror” but have elements or threads of horror.

              Best Horror Scenes is a love letter to the Horror film genre by
              Brandon Durham. Most film clips contain major spoilers, and it is
              recommended you don’t watch the clip if you plan on seeing the
              film.

                  Director David Bruckner made headlines in the film world when
                  he released his first film, The Signal (2007), which was made
                  on a paltry $50,000 budget. A few years later he would be
                  invited to film a segment for the first entry in the V/H/S
                  (2012) series. Now four films into that series, his segment,
                  titled Amateur Night, is still universally considered one of
                  the best segments of the bunch. With The Ritual, we once again
                  see him making magic with an incredibly meager budget, this
                  time topping about $1,000,000. That’s a remarkable feat,
                  especially considering the quality of the final product. This
                  film features above-par acting from every cast member, great
                  direction, is visually stunning with some pretty convincing
                  set design, and lots of effectively eerie shots of the forest
                  that gives it a foreboding life of its own. Strong recommend.
